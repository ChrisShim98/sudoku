 ## Description
Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 in such a way that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

Your objective is to fill every row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid with numbers from 1 to 9 without repeating any number in the same row, column, or sub-grid.

<ul>
<li>Select a difficulty above the Sudoku grid.</li>
<li>Replace the zeros with numbers between 1 to 9 that are unique to their row, column and sub-grid.</li>
<li>Start by looking for rows, columns, or sub-grids with only a few missing numbers, and then use the process of elimination to fill in the missing numbers.</li>
<li>Hit submit once completed.</li>
<li>Hit reset to start a new puzzle at the same difficulty.</li>
</ul>
