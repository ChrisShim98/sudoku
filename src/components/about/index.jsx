      <p>
        Sudoku is a logic-based, number-placement puzzle game that involves
        filling a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9 in such a way that each row,
        column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without
        repetition.

        The game was invented by an American architect, Howard Garns, in 1979
        and was first published in a magazine. It gained popularity in Japan in
        the 1980s, and then spread throughout the world in the early 2000s.
